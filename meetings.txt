I was the moderator for the meeting of my group. My main motive was to discuss the importance of daily stand up meetings for our company. As a moderator, I made sure that everyone had their say and were able to communicate properly which was well received by everyone. Being in a small group, we were also able to discuss pertaining to the topic and not deviate from our discussion.
